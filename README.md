# ContractComparison
This is an old University project for the Web Publishing and Databases module.

The task was to create an information portal using the technologies HMTL4, CSS2, PHP, XML1 and XSLT1.

This is a phone comparison that upon selection from the available combinations the index can offer, will display the relavnt page to compare X phone to Y providers.

I'm well aware this is an ineffecient way to go about making a website like this and is not effeciently scalable too - but I was denied use of a database for this level of coursework and was instructed to use XML.
